## Envato Tuts+ Course: VisBug Quick Start
### Instructor: [Kezz Bracey|](https://tutsplus.com/authors/kezz-bracey)

Project VisBug is a new extension for Chrome (and soon Firefox) that allows you to make almost any change to a site's visuals you need to, all within the browser via a point and click process.

You might be a designer needing to communicate changes to a coder, you might have purchased a template you want to change up a little bit, or you might be a developer looking for an efficient way to test changes in the browser. VisBug can be a massive help in all these departments.

In this course you'll get started quickly with VisBug, learning how to put each of its simple but powerful tools to work.

**Available on [Envato Tuts+](https://tutsplus.com/courses) from January, 2019**
