## Envato Tuts+ Course: VisBug Quick Start + Customize a Template With VisBug
### Instructor: [Kezz Bracey](https://tutsplus.com/authors/kezz-bracey)

Project VisBug is a new extension for Chrome (and soon Firefox) that allows you to make almost any change to a site's visuals you need to, all within the browser via a point and click process.

You might be a designer needing to communicate changes to a coder, you might have purchased a template you want to change up a little bit, or you might be a developer looking for an efficient way to test changes in the browser. VisBug can be a massive help in all these departments.

In these two courses you'll get started quickly with VisBug, learning how to put each of its simple but powerful tools to work. You’ll also learn how to modify the color scheme of a premade template from Envato Elements, replaced its images and text content, all using VisBug and a tiny bit of DevTools, without leaving the browser.

**Available on [Envato Tuts+](https://tutsplus.com/courses) from January, 2019**
